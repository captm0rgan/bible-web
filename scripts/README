scripts
=======
These are the scripts used to generate web.tsv. These are unnecessary for
using bible-web. However, they were essential in creating bible-web initially.
Currently, this directory exists to get these out there. There's a lot
of work to do before these are considered finished.

create_metadata.py
------------------
This creates the metadata.tsv required for compile_tsv.py to generate
web.tsv.

It requires kjv.tsv from kjv to be in the same directory.

format_text_files.sh
--------------------
This reformats the plaintext files you get from the World English Bible
project a bit to make it easier for compile_tsv.py. The WEB files are
obviously required in a plaintext directory.
Currently, the zip of txt files of WEB without the Deuterocanon currently has
the extra books anyway, so you must remove those.
These scripts do not support books outside of the 66 books considered canon by
the majority of, if not all, denominations of Christianity.

compile_tsv.py
--------------
This is the script that generates web.tsv. metadata.tsv and the text files
enerated by format_text_files.sh are requirements for this to run correctly.
