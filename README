bible-web - Read the Word of God from your terminal
===================================================

bible-web is a set of scripts that uses your pager to output the Word of God in
the World English Bible translation.

I picked WEB as the translation because it's the only modern translation of the
Bible that is public domain. 

This project is a fork of kjv. I simply replaced kjv.tsv with web.tsv after
generating it with scripts (which will be posted after some refactoring).

I didn't follow the naming convention of naming the project/binary the same as the
translation because the word "web" is ambiguous with web browsers. I wanted to
be clear with what program you're running when you launch bible-web.

The scripts to generate web.tsv are provided, but they are not needed to use
bible-web.

Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup. bible-web is installed into /usr/local
namespace by default.

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install bible-web (if
necessary as root):
	make clean install
